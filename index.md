# cSploit

The most complete and advanced IT security professional toolkit on Android.

### Like a phoenix

dSploit is a penetration testing suite for Android. After being initially created by evilsocket, tux-mind contributed to it from summer '12 to autumn '14.
In autumn '14 evisocket, the owner of dSploit, choose to merge it into zANTI2, a closed source application developed by zImpremium.

> **NOTE:** evilsocket told, that in a far future zANTI2 will be open source,

As dSploit will oficially merge into zANTI2, I were forced to change the project's name and fork it.

This was when cSploit was born.

### cSploit's target

My final goal is to write an application that is able to:

  - crack wifi
  - enumerate local hosts (*)
  - find vulnerabilities (*)
  - find exploits for these vulnerabilities (*)
  - use those exploits to gain access to the target (*)
  - install backdoors for later access

(*) already implemented

### Portability

Thanks to the new core, cSploit will be easily portable.

Basically it can run on any UNIX-based system, but for now only andorid is supported. When I reach a beta-state version, I will consider working on iOS, OSX, GTK+ and QT.

### Contribute to the code

If you want to contribute, fork the repo you want to contribute to and create a pull request when you're done.
If you actively contribute to the project, I will ask you to join the team.
